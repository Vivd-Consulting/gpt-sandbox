# GPT API

A little sample project that demonstrates OpenAI Functions and provides a useful wrapper around the OpenAI API.

## Setup

Add a `.env` file to the root of the project and specify:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

Next, run the API:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Now you can open the `chat.html` file in your browser and start chatting with the `/spice` endpoint, which has been tuned to behave like an Alien, and can run the `doTheyKnowAboutTheSpice` function.
